# InfoaidTech-Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

This is a repository made for InfoAid Internship's third and final task, in which a machine learning model has to be created to classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

Logistic Regression model has been used to implement credit card fraud detection.

The dataset used for this model is a highly unbalanced dataset, so a lot of preprocessing has been done in order to make correct and precise predictions by the model developed.

The developed model's performance has been evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The dataset used in this code is - creditcard.csv. You can find this dataset from kaggle.
